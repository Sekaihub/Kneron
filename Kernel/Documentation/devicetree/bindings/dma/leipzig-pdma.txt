* Leipzig Peripheral DMA controller

Leipzig Peripheral DMA controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "leipzig-pdma"
- reg: Should contain DMA registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the irq for pdma device.

Examples:

/*
 * Each channel has specific irq
 * ICU parse out irq channel from ICU register,
 * while DMA controller may not able to distinguish the irq channel
 * Using this method, interrupt-parent is required as demuxer
 */
